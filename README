Installation
============

Copy all script files into WinDBG installation directory
(it is "C:\Program Files\Debugging Tools for Windows (x64)\" on my installation).

Running
=======

Open program to be debugged or attach to the running target.
Issue "$$>a< dump_writes_to_file file1" command (lets assume we are interested in 'file1').
You will see:

Bp expression 'KERNEL32!CreateFileW' could not be resolved, adding deferred bp
Bp expression 'KERNEL32!WriteFile' could not be resolved, adding deferred bp
Bp expression 'KERNEL32!CloseHandle' could not be resolved, adding deferred bp
All writes to the file "*file1" will be dumped.

First three lines will absent if KERNEL32 already loaded.
Press F5 or type 'g' and press <Enter> in command window. Program execution begins.
You will see the output like this if writes to the specified file occure:

#3944 -> CreateFile "file1"
#3944 <- 0x00000040
#3944 WriteFile (11 bytes), HANDLE 0x00000040, 0058fdfc  "0123456789"
#3944 WriteFile (11 bytes), HANDLE 0x00000040, 0058fdfc  "0123456789"
#3944 WriteFile (11 bytes), HANDLE 0x00000040, 0058fdfc  "0123456789"
#3944 CloseHandle 0x00000040
